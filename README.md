# SNPP

This repository contains the supplementary code of our manuscript entitled ``Tree-based Representation of Locally Shortest Paths for 2D k-Shortest Non-homotopic Path Planning" which has been submitted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024. 

## Cite This Paper

While our manuscript is still under review, we have made the code available. If you find this repository useful, please consider citing our arxiv paper from which the conference paper is re-written and simplified. The code in this repository will be re-written and re-structured into a ROS package with detailed documentation once the submission is accepted and finalised.
